Implementation:
  I use multithreading to implement the program.
  One problem is that it won't pass the sanity check if I don't force the "
command-reading" thread to sleep for 1 second when it first enters the thread.
According to piazza, the reason is that the commands are passed very fast. It
cannot generate the first report before it gets "OFF" command.
  To fix it, I force the thread_read() thread to sleep for 1 second when we get
there for the first time. It works well.
